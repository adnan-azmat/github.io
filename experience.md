### Research Scholar, [Speech and Language Lab](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/aseschng/speechLab_intro.html), NTU Singapore <span style="float: right; font-size: 14px;">Sep 2023 - Present</span>

- Under the guidance of Prof. Chng Eng Siong, my research subject is speaker diarization, specifically focusing on enhancing Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) model.

- Implemented a robust data pipeline for training the transformers based TS-VAD model on large wideband simulated data. Extended the model to handle arbitrary number of speakers, enhancing its versatility. Demonstrated the effectiveness of the TS-VAD model in achieving impressive results in the DIHARD3 challenge.

- Proposed and integrated speaker counting, speech enhancement and speech separation techniques to solve far-field speaker diarization in noisy-condition.

### Software Engineer, [Special Clouds](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/sovereignty/cloud), Microsoft, Noida, India <span style="float: right; font-size: 14px;">July 2021 - Aug 2023</span>

### Software Engineer Intern, [Outlook Calendaring](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/email-and-calendar-software-microsoft-outlook), Microsoft, Bengaluru, India <span style="float: right; font-size: 14px;">Jan 2021 - June 2021</span>

- Re‑engineered Outlook events and calendar APIs, shifting from a monolith to a micro‑services architecture using gRPC.

- Designed and developed a traffic splitter tool to redirect traffic to the modernized APIs while also collecting metrics and telemetry for analysis.

- Traffic splitter enabled safe and staged roll‑out and testing of modernized APIs worldwide while handling an average of 15 billion hits a month.

### Software Engineer Intern, Evee Bot for [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), Microsoft, Bengaluru, India <span style="float: right; font-size: 14px;">May 2020 - July 2020</span>

- Evee intelligently manages calendar events and schedules work meetings inside Microsft Teams. My contributions empowered Evee to intelligently propose a meeting subject line whenever a real-time chat conversation indicates an intent to set up a meeting.

- Trained, tested and fine-tuned Azure Language Understanding (LUIS) and keyword extraction models using the Enron Corpus. Proposed a bi-directional LSTM model for custom data.

- Seamlessly incorporated the model with an exceptional BLEU score of 0.89 into the bot using Azure Bot Service.
