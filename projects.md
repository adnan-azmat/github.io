Here is a non-exhaustive list of my projects. My research work can be found <a href="/research">here</a>.

- **Inventory Management Portal**; November 2019
    - Designed and implemented a portal for warehouses to effectively manage their inventory using Python, Django and SQLite.
    - A browser-based graphic interface was also provided, for ease of access.

- **SAP Computer**; February - March 2020
  - Implemented and tested the simple-as-possible computer, a basic model of a microprocessor in Verilog, a hardware description
    language.
  - Developed an understanding of how a microprocessor works, interacts with memory and other parts of the system like input
    and output.

- **Multiplayer Quiz Game Show**; March - April 2020
    - Designed a multi-player p2p network-based game using Pygame for graphics and TCP sockets as the network component.
    - Reinforced the concepts of socket and network programming through a real-world problem.

- **IAS Machine**; August - September 2020
    - Designed the processor and memory of the first electronic computer built at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS),
      Princeton using Java.
    - Developed a solid understanding of the von Neumann architecture and other concepts of computer architecture and organization.

- **Logistics Simulation**; September - October 2020
    - Designed and implemented a logistics handling system to route packages from one location to another, using Java.
    - Developed a good understanding of the object-oriented style of programming, and the GUI widget toolkit Swing.

- **UCINET DL file reader**; October - November 2020
    - Used concepts of object-oriented programming in C++ and read in .dl files and performed required manipulations and
      wrote back into the file.

- **Personal Data Store**; August - November 2021
    - Designed and implemented a database in C to store information about a person.
    - CRUD operations were carried out on this database.
    - Further, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) was also used to interface MySQL with Java, for an enhanced version of the
      project. 

- **Kaggle Malware Prediction Competition**; October - November 2021
    - Competed in a Kaggle competition for malware classification. Carried out batch-wise processing due to the big data nature
      of input, tried out various strategies for high classification accuracy and finally settled on a LightGBM setup.

- **Data Processing using Hadoop MapReduce**; February 2022
    -  Processed, analyzed big data sources (Wikipedia entries) and ran semantic queries on it using Hadoop MapReduce, a
       distributed computing algorithm, in Java.

- **Edge Computing using EdgeX Foundry**; April 2022
    -  Created a mood lighting setup for a room using a mock setup of LEDs and Raspberry Pi (hardware end) and EdgeX Foundry,
       Docker and Python (software end).
    - Computing was carried at the edge of the network, free from network constraints and latency.

- **Course Allocation System**; April 2022
    - Implemented a multi-threaded educational server and client application.
    - Used semaphores to protect data members while they were being accessed.
