### [CNRS UMR 5516 Laboratoire Hubert Curien](https://laboratoirehubertcurien.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html), [Université de Lyon](https://www.universite-lyon.fr/version-anglaise/universite-de-lyon-en-6709.kjsp), September 2023 – December 2023, jointly supervised by [Dr Pierre Maret](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/mapi9921/) and [Dr Christo El Morr](https://www.christoelmorr.ca/about.html)

Part of a health informatics project jointly run by Laboratoire Hubert Curien, York University and [The QA Company](https://the-qa-company.com/).

Developed a novel method to query websites, documents, and tables through a natural language interface using large language models, knowledge graphs, and a question-answering system generator. Proposed an approach to extract tables from PDFs and convert them to knowledge graphs to enable querying PDF text and tables simultaneously, overcoming limitations of language models.

Disseminated my work through posters and presentations at IEEE Saint Etienne Innovation Day and Manutech-SLEIGHT Science Event #11. Work on short and full papers underway.

### [ScaDS](https://bda-lab.github.io/), [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), May 2022 – April 2023, supervised by [Dr Vinu E Venugopal](https://sites.google.com/site/vinueviitm)

Worked on creating an ontology for fire emergency planning and support in a group of buildings at a university campus. It involved using first-order logic to create terminologies (tbox) and assertions (abox) and perform reasoning using Protege, Owlready2 and HermiT under the mentorship of Prof. Vinu E Venugopal. Further, used Apache Spark and Kafka (in Python, Jupyter setups) to simulate a streaming setup on the big data and perform rate-testing of reasoning on a cluster computing setup to demonstrate the scalability of stream-based reasoning.

### [Center for Sustainable Mobility](https://csm.iiitd.ac.in/), [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), May 2022 – August 2022, supervised by [Dr Anuj Grover](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/anuj-grover)

Conducted research focused on the development of cost-effective GPS modules tailored for e-rickshaws and auto-rickshaws, aiming to enhance last-mile connectivity within the urban landscape of Delhi, India. Worked on the deployment of a real-time operating system to ensure the seamless operation of the GPS modules.
