### [CBEA](https://bda-lab.github.io/), [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), May 2022 – present, supervised by [Dr Vinu E Venugopal](https://sites.google.com/site/vinueviitm)

At the Center for Big Data Engineering and Analytics, IIIT Bangalore, headed by my current supervisor Vinu Venugopal, I have been working on Reason-AIR, a project in collaboration with the University of Luxembourg and IIIT Delhi intending to develop a distributed high-performance reasoning system for Description Logic (DL) ontologies. Specifically, developing a baseline system integrating Apache Spark and the Owlready2 API. We are designing a use case (and a pattern of applications) where the reasoning over streaming data is useful and envisage a system design that helps to attain a high maximum sustainable throughput (MST) in the stream reasoning context. I have also made a paper submission at a well-known data science conference based on my contributions.

We worked on the research problem of building low-cost GPS modules for e-rickshaws and auto-rickshaws to improve last mile
connectivity in Delhi, India. I implemented a real-time operating systems for the GPS modules to function.
