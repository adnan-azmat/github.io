    <p>Hello there, welcome to my page on the web!<br><br>My name is Kautuk Raj, currently a fourth-year undergraduate
        pursuing an Integrated Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in">IIIT Bangalore</a>
        with dual specializations in AI-ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) and DS (Digital Society). I am
        currently a project intern at the <a href="https://bda-lab.github.io/">Big Data Analytics Research Group of IIIT Bangalore</a>.
        <br><br>

        I hail from the exemplary and illustrious city of Jamshedpur, which, apart from being the country's steel capital,
        is also the first planned city in India. <br><br>

        I maintain a list of research projects undertaken in the <a href="/research/">Research</a> page, and a list of
        projects in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> page.<br><br>

        A list of positions held across my school and college can be found in the <a href="/positions/">Positions</a>
        page, my extracurricular activities are present in the <a href="/extracurriculars">Extracurriculars</a>
        page.<br><br>

        Please have a look around and feel free to contact me. <br><br>

        Outside of work, I enjoy running, quizzing, and pretending to be a driving aficionado. <br><br>



        To get a better insight on my academic life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">CV</a> page. </p>
